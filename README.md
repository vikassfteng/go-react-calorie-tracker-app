# Calorie Tracker

Calorie Tracker is a web application that allows users to track their daily calorie intake. The backend is developed using Go, and the frontend is built with React and Bootstrap. MongoDB is used for the database.

## Features

- Track daily calorie intake
- Add new entries for each meal
- Update the details of an entry
- Update the ingredients of an entry
- Delete an entry

## System Architecture

1. User Interface (React + Bootstrap): This is where the user interacts with the application. It communicates with the Backend to fetch, create, update, and delete entries.

2. Backend (Go): This is the server-side of your application. It processes requests from the User Interface, performs operations on the database, and returns responses.

3. Database (MongoDB): This is where your application's data is stored. The Backend communicates with the Database to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

## Installation

2. Install the dependencies: `go get`
